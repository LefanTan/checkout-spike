## Spike project to test out frameworks/libraries and proof of concept.

Currently using Typescript for the project.

### CSS Framework: 
1. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) (using [tailwind-react-native-classnames](https://github.com/jaredh159/tailwind-react-native-classnames)): Tailwind CSS is a utility based css framework. 
    - Note: tailwind css is not natively compatible with react-native, but it's good to have to quickly built components

2. [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/): Also a utility framework, but it's built for react native and web. 

### Other libraries:
1. React Navigation: for navigating between tabs
    - comes with react-native-reanimated as dependencies

2. [React Native](https://oblador.github.io/react-native-vector-icons/) Vector Icons : free and nice icons
